    >
    > -   install RStudio
    >
    >     <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download>
    >
    > -   install the R packages needed for installation by executing the following code in RStudio:
    >
    >         install.packages(c("devtools","installr","remotes"))
    >
    > -   install RTools 35 by executing the following code in RStudio:
    >
    >         installr::install_rtools()
    >
    > -   install the R package mongolite 1.0 by executing the following code in RStudio:
    >
    >          remotes::install_version("mongolite","1.0")

2.  get and install the actual version of the *ZKW distance calculation R package*:

    > -   go to Github webpage: 
    >
    >     <https://github.com/juleZWK/RJobDistanceMetric/>
    >
    > -   klick on newest release and download it
    >
    >    <image src = "figures/GitHub_new_package_release.png" align="center" width="600"/>
    >
    > -   choose the tar.gz file and save it on your local disk
    >
    > -   in RStudio set the working directory to the folder where you have downloaded the tar.gz file, you may use the following R command:
    >
    >         setwd(choose.dir())
    >
    > -   install the ZKW distance calculation package by executing the following code in RStudio (edit filename and set it to the name of the downloaded tar.gz file, if necessary):
    >
    >         filename <- "RJobDistanceMetric_3.0.0.tar.gz"
    >         tmpdir <- tempdir()
    >         untar(filename, exdir = tmpdir)
    >         devtools::install(file.path(tmpdir, "RJobDistanceMetric"), dependencies = TRUE)

3.  start your analysis in RStudio:

    > -   in RStudio create a “New Project” and name it approbiately or select a existing project, where you want to add the distance calculation
    >
    > -   create a “New File” and choose the “RMarkdown” file type
    >
    > -   select “From Template” and choose the “Distance Calculation” template
    >
    > -   save a copy into your project directory and follow instructions in the template

💌 *please feedback any issues occurring during installation*

### supporting notes

-   The **developmental package** version can be installed from github repository directly. To do so, execute the following code in RStudio.:

        devtools::install_github("juleZWK/RJobDistanceMetric")

-   If you need to have the flowCore package installed:

    ```{r,eval=FALSE}
    if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
        install.packages("BiocManager")

    BiocManager::install("flowCore")
    ```
